# Homebrew Tap for Geant4

Currently experimental and under test - do not use for active work.

# Test procedure
```
$ brew tap drbenmorgan/geant4
$ brew install geant4
```

Try building any example application (compatible with the current 11.0.2
version).

NB: at present, only GDML is in the build, there are no graphics drivers
other than the defaults.
